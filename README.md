<!-- 
- This repo is not only for learning Html but also for exploring git and Github.
- I want to learn how multiple people can work on a single project, in this case a html web page .
- Also instead of conventional start , we will use cloning of this repo .

## 101

- #### "DOCTYPE" Declaration
    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    ```
    - This declaration tells the web browser that the page is written in HTML5. It is a standard practice and ensures the browser renders the page correctly.  
    - This single line is the starting point for every modern web page.

- #### **root** Element
    - In this step, you will add the `<html>` element. This element is the root container for all other HTML elements on the page (except for the <!DOCTYPE> declaration).
    - It's also a best practice to include the lang attribute inside the opening `<html>` tag. This attribute specifies the language of the document's content, which helps search engines and screen readers. For English, we use lang="en".
    - In your index.html file, add the `<html>` and `</html>` tags right after the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration.

    ```html
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html lang="en"> </html>
    ```
    - All other elements of your webpage will go between these two tags.
